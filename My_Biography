My name is Laura Camila Pinzón, I´m 21 years old, I´m student of systems engineering at the University of Cundianarca.
I was born in fusagasuga cundinamarca on September 9, 1997. I studied my elementary school at Camilo Torres, then I studied my high school in the municipality of Viota, there I lived with my dad, when I graduated, I went back to fusagasugá and started studying at the University of Cundinamarca since 2015.
During these years of study at the University I have learned not only about Engineering but also about life, about being a better person in all areas of my life.
During my life I have had good and bad moments but I have always seen God in everything, and thanks to Him I am here.
